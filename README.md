````
CREATE USER 'dbbackup'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY  '***';

GRANT SELECT , 
RELOAD ,

SUPER , 
LOCK TABLES ,

#### Write `config.py`

Rename `config-example.py` to `config.py` and replace the content properly.

## Usage

#### Immediate backup

````
./immediate_backup.py
````

#### Routine backup

````
./routine_backup.sh
````

First backup will not take place immediately. For example, if `config.ROUTINE_DAYS`
is set to 7, the first backup will start after 7 days.

The log is written into `routine_backup.log`.
